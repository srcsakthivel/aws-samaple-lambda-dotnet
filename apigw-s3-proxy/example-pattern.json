        "This pattern deploys an Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoint with a S3 read-only integration",
        "The API exposes 3 GET methods:",
        "Root GET method: it provides a list of the S3 buckets of the account where the stack is deployed.",
        "{folder} GET method: it provides a list of the objects contained in the bucket {folder}",
        "{item} GET method: it returns the contents of the object {item}.",
        "The template also deploys an IAM role with S3 read-only capabilities that is used by API Gateway to integrate with S3.",
        "Since this is API Gateway effectively acts as a proxy S3, every GET method is protected by IAM authentication to prevent public access."
