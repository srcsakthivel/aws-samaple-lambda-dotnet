# Integration of Amazon EventBridge with Amazon SNS and Amazon Lambda 

The SAM template deploys a EventBridge rule with target as SNS topic which has a Lambda function as subscription and the IAM permissions required to run the application. Whenever the EventBridge rule gets triggered, the Lambda function is invoked by the SNS topic. The AWS SAM template deploys the resources and the IAM permissions required to run the application.

Learn more about this pattern at Serverless Land Patterns: https://serverlessland.com/patterns/eventbridge-sns-lambda/.

Important: this application uses various AWS services and there are costs associated with these services after the Free Tier usage - please see the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details. You are responsible for any AWS costs incurred. No warranty is implied in this example.

## Requirements


* [Create an AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html) if you do not already have one and log in. The IAM user that you use must have sufficient permissions to make necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources.
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured
* [Git Installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) (AWS SAM) installed

## Deployment Instructions


1. Create a new directory, navigate to that directory in a terminal and clone the GitHub repository:
    ``` 
    git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-patterns
    ``` 
    
2. Change directory to the pattern directory:
    ``` 
    cd eventbridge-sns-lambda
    ``` 
3. From the command line, use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources for the pattern as specified in the template.yaml file:
    ``` 
    sam deploy --guided
    ``` 
4. During the prompts:
    
         * Enter a stack name
         * Enter the desired AWS Region
         * Allow SAM CLI to create IAM roles with the required permissions.
    
    Once you have run sam deploy -guided mode once and saved arguments to a configuration file (samconfig.toml), you can use sam deploy in future to use these defaults.
    
5. Note the outputs from the SAM deployment process. These contain the resource names and/or ARNs which are used for testing.
    

## Testing

Create a new test EC2 instance or modify(start/stop) an existing test EC2 instance to trigger the Eventbridge rule.


Check the CloudWatch logs of the Lambda function to see the SNS event JSON.


## Cleanup


1. Delete the stack 
    ```
    sam delete
    ```
2. Confirm the stack has been deleted 
    ```
    aws cloudformation list-stacks â€”query "StackSummaries[?contains(StackName,'STACK_NAME')].StackStatus"
    ```
